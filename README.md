This is my final course work for my degree in computer engineering.

Computational Gastronomy is a new scientific field that results from the recent technological advances, which combines computer science with big-data in gastronomy. As of today, computational gastronomy has been expanding our understanding about gastronomy not previously possible, for example, the world-wide study of food-pairing hypothesis and the data-driven formulation of new hypothesis such as the food-bridging. In this work we have as main goals to use a dataset resulting from the abstraction of traditional Portuguese cookbooks, which will allow us to: (1) study how the Portuguese gastronomy fits into the hypotheses of food-pairing and food-bridging and (2) also study how these variables vary within different Portuguese regions. As of today, framing the Portuguese gastronomy on these important variables was still an open scientific question, which we address in this work.
